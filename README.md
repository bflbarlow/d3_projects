My personal journey in D3.

## Biography

I am Benjamin Barlow, a multi-faceted tech nerd living in Madison, Wisconsin. I have a wide variety of skills and hobbies that range from photography to web development. The favorite pastime has been (and probably always will be) theatre. For the four (and-a-half) years I spent studying Mathematics at UW-Platteville, I participated in 20 productions. That is almost one production every 80 days for 54 straight months (thatâ€™s how you really put a math degree to work!).

My real life super power is the ability to visualize relational data manipulation in my head. Essentially, it is instinctively easy for me to understand, query, and plan/model relational data.

## d3_projects Structure

Each folder is an individualized d3 project named related to the functionality being explored. Each d3 project will have an index.html file and a d3.js file. Often, it will have an accompanying data folder which will hold the csv used in the d3.js file.

## Goals for the Project

It is my hope that this journey builds experience in d3 and yields template code that can be used for all d3 development going forward.
